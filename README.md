# NACA 0012 Aerodynamic Analysis

This project presents a low-fidelity computational aerodynamic analysis of a NACA 0012 airfoil implemented in Python.

The objective of the study is to investigate the relationship between airfoil geometry, surface pressure distribution and lift generation using simplified mathematical modelling techniques.

The project includes:
- Airfoil geometry generation using NACA four-digit equations
- Thin airfoil theory lift prediction
- Low-fidelity pressure coefficient modelling
- Lift calculation via pressure integration
- Comparison with classical aerodynamic theory

The work demonstrates how mathematical modelling and numerical implementation can be used to gain physical insight into aerodynamic behaviour.
